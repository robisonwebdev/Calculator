# Calculator - [Live Preview](https://robisonwebdev.github.io/Calculator/)

## Objective of Calculator Project
I am to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I attempted to figure out solutions, to construct expressions without using
built-in functions (like eval()) to do the work for me. 

## Features to add
- Setup backspace button.
- Add keyboard support.
- Add hover/click effects for buttons

## Issues to fix
- Plus/Minus button isn't putting plus/minus on correct display number if multiple numbers are entered.
- Should only be able to enter one operator at a time, currently can enter multiple.
- Shouldn't be able to enter operator before any number inputs.
- If operator is entered after last number, should auto delete it.
- Can currently enter multiple decimal points, should only be one per number and only for numbers.
